# Data Structures and Challenges Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for solutions to various programming challenges and principles of data structures! This project aims to be a comprehensive collection of well-explained, thoroughly-tested examples that demonstrate the core concepts of data structures, as well as solutions to some of the most common programming challenges.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: A deep dive into various data structures like linked lists, arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Challenges**: A set of programming challenges, each with its own detailed explanation and unit tests.
